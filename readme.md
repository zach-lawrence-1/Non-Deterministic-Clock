# Non Deterministic Text Clock
## Inspiration
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plFwBqBYpcY
## Description
A real time clock displayed in the terminal in a fancy way. Uses random text generation to act as the background, and the clock numbers themselves with color included. The code files clock_shapes.cpp, clock_time.cpp, and random_text.cpp are modified and combined into ND_clock.cpp to create the final display.
## How To Run
### Downloading The Code
Download the code and make file as follows
Git:
1. ```git clone https://github.com/zach-lawrence-1/Non-Deterministic-Clock.git c```
   - c can be any local directory you want.
2. ```cd c```

OR

Just download zip from github and unzip where you want
### Windows
On windows, as long as you have MSYS2 setup with g++ and you can run make files then you should be able to run the main program clock_ND.cpp as follows:
1. Download code and make file.
2. Open a terminal in the same directory as the code and make file.
3. Type in ```make ND```
4. run ```./ND.exe``` or ```./ND```
### Linux
As long as you have g++ and make installed and running on your linux box, you should be able to run the main program as follows:
1. Open a terminal in the same directory as the code and make file or just navigate there via cd commands.
2. Type in ```make ND```
3. run ```./ND```

You can also run ```make ct```, ```make random```, ```make shapes``` and execute the associated executable/elf files to run the individual pieces I broke the problem into if you want.
## Updates
1. Got idea/inspired and wrote random text generator which generates a fixed size block of random characters, then wrote a basic clock using ctime.
2. Implemented a basic idea of how I want to display the clock text and color scheme.
3. Clock now kind of works, but it is crooked. I need to fix some unknown spacing issue.

4. Clock is now working correctly.

5. Clock is now cross platform between windows and linux, I have no way of testing for mac so idk if it works there.
